# Pandas Series

A series is very similar to a Numpy array. Unlike Numpy, series can have axis labels, that is it can be indexed by a label instead of just a number location. It can also hold any Python object.

# Pandas DataFrames

A DataFrame is a bunch of Series objects put together to share the same index.
